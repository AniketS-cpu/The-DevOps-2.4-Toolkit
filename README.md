Mastering Go, now in its fourth edition, remains the go-to resource for real-world Go development. This comprehensive guide delves into advanced Go concepts, including RESTful servers, and Go memory management. This edition brings new chapters on Go Generics and fuzzy Testing, and an enriched exploration of efficiency and performance. As you work your way through the chapters, you will gain confidence and a deep understanding of advanced Go topics, including concurrency and the operation of the Garbage Collector, using Go with Docker, writing powerful command-line utilities, working with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data, and interacting with databases.

You will be engaged in real-world exercises, build network servers, and develop robust command-line utilities. With in-depth chapters on RESTful services, the WebSocket protocol, and Go internals, you are going to master Go's nuances, optimization, and observability. You will also elevate your skills in efficiency, performance, and advanced testing.

With the help of Mastering Go, you will become an expert Go programmer by building Go systems and implementing advanced Go techniques in your projects.</details>
